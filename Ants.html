                      <p>Setting: On a stoop in Brooklyn, New York. Mid-January.</p>

                      <p> Carla (early 30’s): Dressed in athletic clothes. Feisty and imaginative. </p>
                     
                      <p>CARLA</p>
                            
                      <p>You know, ants only have two hundred and fifty thousand brain cells. Yup. I’ve always wondered, how do they get so organized? Their perfect lines, rueful persistence, work ethic. Basically all I’ve always wanted to be in life. Are they being controlled by some extraterrestrial force or do they really do that because they know to? I know that you’ve always hated how I threw my clothes in the drawer after doing laundry but imagine just being neat? Just because it’s who we are as a species. Wouldn’t that be amazing? Or do you think there are messy ants out there? That’s what I would like to see. Maybe you should do a movie about that! I don’t know, or maybe not. I wish I did more correct things by “instinct” you know? That would be great. Maybe I would be a nurse by instinct and my grandma would stop asking me if I’m really actually a prostitute for a living. Well the truth is… I sort of am, grandma… I sort of am. </p>
                      <p> So, here I am… to tell you that um… yeah, first of all thank you for opening the door, it’s freezing out here. I can feel the heat coming from inside… Oh no, no, I.. you don’t have to...I don’t want to come in. Really. I just… yeah cool. No, I’m good out here. I really can focus on things like the veins of my toes. I neglect them, so this is good. </p>
                      <p>(a beat)</p>
                      <p>Did you know there are twelve thousand species of ants in the world and they can lift twenty times their body weight? I mean...How can they do this but then get squished so easily? That’s an obvious question but also...should we be learning something from them about force distribution?- I promise, I have a point. How come there are people out there studying ants enough to know how many species there are but they haven’t figured out the force thing yet? Like for humans to apply it, you know? I would personally benefit a lot from knowing the secrets of heavy lifting. Us humans though, we sure can get squished. I’ve personally experienced it. It’s more metaphorical but honestly it can be literal too, like what if a car-</p>
                      <p>Wait, no, don’t listen to me, my brain is just frozen. I brought you my key, so… here. </p>
                      <p>(Doesn’t give the key back.)</p>
                      <p>One last thing- Ants actually have this thing called the “exoskeleton” that is like an armour around their bodies. How crazy is that? Wouldn’t it be cool if we had a built-in armour? And antennas to touch and taste things like (imitates an ant with it’s antennas)... like oh hi I’m an ant try to squish me now sucker, I have a skeleton, and then we could have an antenna boxing match. (she pretends to box with her fake antennas). That would be fucking wild.</p>
                      <p>If we were ants I would be allowed back into my apartment because I would be a queen or a soldier or have some kind of high-ranking title and you poor little man-ant would have to get out of my way you know? And give me Tommy back, and my life, and the furniture I picked out at West Elm, and my bed, and my books, my fairy lights, my tv, my dvd’s, my kitchenware!  You would’ve bowed down at my feet, and stayed with me forever, and not lied, and been patient, and stood by me, and not have done all the things you did because you would respect me or, at the very least, be afraid. I want you to be afraid of me for once. </p>
                      <p>(A beat. The door shuts.)</p>
                      <p>Maybe I’ll come back at another time. </p>
                      <p> (She leaves with the key in her hand.)</p>
